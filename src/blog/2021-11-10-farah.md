We do have an open feature request for that, but no plans to implement. Today you can accomplish the workflow using other services in several ways:

1. build your deploys as you commit, use [locked deploys 10](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/manage-deploys/#locked-deploys) to pin one, and use our API to update on your schedule: [https://open-api.netlify.com/#operation/restoreSiteDeploy 11](https://open-api.netlify.com/#operation/restoreSiteDeploy) + then relock: [https://open-api.netlify.com/#operation/lockDeploy 4](https://open-api.netlify.com/#operation/lockDeploy)
2. use an [incoming webhook 10](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-hooks) and you can trigger a new build + deploy at will. Most useful for sites that pull content from some other source like a CMS that isn’t storing its files in your repo already - since no change in git may not equal no change in site content!

To trigger these, you will need the third party service:

either a cron server that you run - all of those flows are scriptable\
or something like a scheduled zap from [zapier.com 4](http://zapier.com/). These are free for a few uses per month, less free as your usage goes up.

I’ve added your voice to the open feature request so we shall follow up in this thread if our product support for this evolves!
